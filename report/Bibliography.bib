@article{Rosdi2011,
abstract = {In this paper, a personal verification method using finger vein is presented. Finger vein can be considered more secured compared to other hands based biometric traits such as fingerprint and palm print because the features are inside the human body. In the proposed method, a new texture descriptor called local line binary pattern (LLBP) is utilized as feature extraction technique. The neighbourhood shape in LLBP is a straight line, unlike in local binary pattern (LBP) which is a square shape. Experimental results show that the proposed method using LLBP has better performance than the previous methods using LBP and local derivative pattern (LDP).},

	title = {Biometric Person Identification Using Near-infrared Hand-dorsa Vein Images},
	abstract = {Bi ometric  recognition  is  becoming  more  and  more  important  with  the  increasi ng 
demand  for  security,  and  more  usable  wit h  the  improvement  of   computer  vision  as  well 
as  patt ern  recognition  t echnologies.  Hand  vei n  patterns  have  been  recognised  as  a  good 
biometric  measure  f or  personal  identif ication  due  to  many  excellent  characteristi cs,  such 
as  uniqueness  and  stabi lity,  as  well  as  difficulty  to  copy  or  forge.  This  t hesis  covers  all 
the  research  and  development  aspects  of  a  biometric  person  i dentif ication  system  based 
on  near-inf rared hand-dorsa vei n images. 
Firstly,  the  design  and  realisation  of  an  optimised  vein  image  capt ure  device  is 
presented.  In  order  to  maximise  the  quality  of  the  captured  images  with  relatively  low 
cost,  the  infrared  ill umi nati on  and  imaging  theory  are  discussed.   Then  a  database 
containing  2040  images  from  102  indivi dual s,   which  were  captured  by  this  device,   is 
intr oduced. 
Secondly,   image  analysis  and  the  customised  image  pre-pr ocessing  methods  are 
discussed. The  consistency of  the database  images  is evaluat ed using mean squared  error 
({MSE})  and  peak  signal-to-noise  ratio  ({PSNR}).  Geometrical  pre-processi ng,  includi ng 
shearing  correction  and  regi on  of   interest  ({ROI})  extracti on,  is  introduced  to  improve 
image consistency.  Image  noise  i s evaluat ed usi ng  total  variance  ( {TV})  values.  Grey-level 
pre-processing,  includi ng  grey-level  normalisation,   f iltering  and  adaptive  hi st ogram 
equalisation are applied to enhance vei n  patter ns. 
Thirdly,   a  gradient-based  image  segmentation  algorit hm  is  compared  with  popular 
algorithms  in  references  like  Niblack  and  Threshol d  Image  algorithm  to  demonstrate  its 
effectiveness  i n  vei n  patt ern  extraction.   Post-pr ocessing  methods  includi ng 
morphological f iltering and thinning are also presented. 
Fourthly,  feature  extraction  and  recognition  methods  are  investigated,   with  several 
new  approaches  based  on  keypoints  and  l ocal  binary  patterns  ({LBP})  proposed.  Through 
comprehensive comparison with ot her approaches based on structure and text ure features 
as  well  as  performance  evaluation  using  t he  database  created  with  2040  images,   the 
proposed  appr oach  based  on  multi-scale  partition  {LBP}  is  shown  t o  provi de  the  best 
recogniti on perf ormance with an  identification rate of nearly 99\%. 
Finally,  the  whole  hand-dorsa  vein  identification  system  is  present ed  with  a  user 
interf ace for admini stration of user information andfor person  identification.},
