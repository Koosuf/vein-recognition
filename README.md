Vein Recognition
================

This is the code for my undergraduate thesis on Biometric Vein Recognition.

The resulting thesis can be found here: http://goo.gl/mqSh1i

The "experiements" directory contains the code used to test various pre-processing, feature extraction and classification algorithms. The "clean" directory contains a few demoes and generally, cleaner version of the relevant code. It can be used to reproduce the resutls presented in the thesis.
